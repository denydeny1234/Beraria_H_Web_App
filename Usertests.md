## Introduction

As I delved into the design phase, I recognized the critical need to validate and refine each aspect of the project to ensure it resonated with Beraria H's unique identity. This imperative led me to conduct user tests, a pivotal step in crafting a user-centric and brand-aligned design.

## Choose design path

The initiation of the design process prompted a crucial decision-making phase where I sought to identify the most effective approach for Beraria H's digital identity. To accomplish this, I committed to developing [three distinct prototypes](url) for the homepage. The primary goal was to ascertain which design would best encapsulate Beraria H's identity.

### Gathering clients' feedback

After presenting the initial designs to Beraria H's clients, the invaluable feedback received played a pivotal role in shaping the next steps of the UI development.

**Testing task:**
Check all 3 designs and tell me why you like one better than the other. Be specific.
