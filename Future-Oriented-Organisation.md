I created a concept document, participated in debriefing sessions, andÂ created a project plan in order to investigate the organisational context. These documents offered a roadmap for ethical and sustainable considerations in addition to identifying the company domain and stakeholders. I managed the project's execution, making sure that research activities, risks, and solution quality were all in line with Beraria H's overall goals.
