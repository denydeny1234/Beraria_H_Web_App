## Process

### Logo Usage Guidelines
Considering Beraria H's dedication to preserving the authenticity of their established visual identity, namely their logo, this UI Style Guide carefully avoided suggesting changes to the current logo design. Because Beraria H has a well-established brand, the decision not to perform logo alterations was made with the strategic goal of maintaining brand continuity and recognition.  Thus, the primary focus of this style guide is on optimising and improving the web application's design aspects in order to maintain the pre-established brand rules and provide a smooth user experience.

### Colour palette
The choice of the accent orange (#F39314) reflects Beraria H's energetic and inviting personality.  For this reason, their logo also features it. I wanted to maintain their identity by sticking to the colour.  Moreover, I keep a balance for better readability and visual hierarchy by using secondary colours, such as grey tones.

### Typography rules

#### Font selection
In order to convey the essence of the brand,Â modern and approachable, I gave great thought to the typography used for Beraria H. I finally settled on the Montserrat typeface after careful consideration. Montserrat perfectly captures the modernity I wish to portray with its clean lines and contemporary vibe. Its bold variant, which is used especially for headings, highlights important details and gives a bit of boldness.

#### Font Sizes and Line Height
I created the following rules to guarantee an enjoyable and comfortable reading experience:

##### Heading sizes:
- H1: 25px
- H2: 20px
- H3: 16px

##### Body text size:
- Body: 14px

##### Line height
- The interface maintains a constant line height of 30px, which improves readability and facilitates content digestion.

## Insights and decision making

### Consistency across platforms
The need for consistency across multiple platforms and devices led to the development of a style guide. This styleguide will be useful for upcoming desktop app implementations, as my project primarily focuses on the mobile version of the application. By guaranteeing a cohesive user experience, it strengthens the Beraria H brand.

### User centric design
Readability and user-friendly interactions were taken into consideration when selecting fonts and sizes. The results of user testing revealed how crucial readable and clear text is to a satisfying user experience. Since the "About us" page has the most text, that is where the majority of the testing was done. [Check the tests.](url)

### Brand representation
The brand personality of Beraria H was intended to be reflected in the colour scheme. My choice was impacted by the information I learned from competitor analysis, since the black tones combined with a striking colour most closely matched an event app.
