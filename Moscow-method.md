### Introduction

\
<span dir="">I have used the MoSCoW method as a prioritisation technique in my project to manage and define feature requirements in an organised manner. I hope to create a clear hierarchy of importance for every feature in the event scheduler app by grouping features into four categories: Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. This approach is crucial to directing the project's development because it assists me in determining which features should be included in the first release and which should be saved for later iterations. I make sure the app's main features are in line with the main goals of increasing event discoverability, boosting user satisfaction, and speeding the ticket buying process. With this strategy, I can concentrate on providing users with the most important features that solve their biggest problems, while also providing space for future improvements during later stages of development.

## Update

It was not practical to directly implement the "Secure payment must have" feature on the main website because Beraria H chose to continue working with YellowTickets, an outside website for ticket purchases. Instead, my attention turned to improving user comprehension of Beraria H's purchasing procedures and enabling easy access to the ticketing website.  I have developed a simplified method to lead users to their destination with ease.
