### Introduction

<span dir="">The Definition of Done is a set of criteria or conditions that a user story or task must meet to be considered complete and ready for release. For Must-have features identified through the MoSCoW method, the DoD is essential in ensuring that these core functionalities are developed to a high standard, meet user requirements, and are fully functional. It helps maintain a clear understanding of when a Must-have feature is considered done and can be integrated into the project. By linking the DoD to Must-have features, I ensure that these critical components receive the necessary attention and meet the project's primary objectives before moving on to other features. This alignment helps maintain focus on priority items and ensures a solid foundation for the project.</span>
