## Introduction
Ioana was my company supervisor throughout the whole internship. She deals with marketing, but also Graphic and Web Design, so all her advice was very helpful as she was experienced in more areas.

## Regular meetings
Every week, we held meetings, either in person at the office or virtually via  WhatsApp. Ioana offered to help me with any questions I had regarding the app or to mentor me as I learned Photoshop.

## Learning
Considering how inexperienced I was with graphic design when I first started at Beraria H, Ioana was essential in helping me develop my abilities. Through her mentorship, I've gained the confidence to design starting with conceptual visualisations to producing a variety of posters. I now take pride in my ability to bring creative concepts to life, all thanks to Ioana's mentoring.
