## Introduction
During this internship, the main way of communication with the marketing team was through WhatsApp. 

## Web app
WhatsApp was the platform where I could send pieces of my project and get feedback back, such as research documents that I have done, or Figma prototypes. 

## Media products
The posters I have worked on using Photoshop for Beraria H's events were also delivered on WhatsApp, but using an external website, namely [Wetransfer](https://wetransfer.com), where I could attach larger files, such as photoshop files and jpg images.
