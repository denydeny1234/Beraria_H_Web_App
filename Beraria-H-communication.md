## Introduction
During my internship, WhatsApp's effortless platform was the main means of communication with the marketing team. 

## Web app
WhatsApp has become the preferred platform for exchanging project components and getting insightful feedback. The collaborative process, whether it was exchanging  research documents or Figma prototypes, found its place in the chat.

## Media products
The eye-catching Photoshop posters that I meticulously designed for Beraria H's events  made their way to the marketing department. Making use of an external website, [Wetransfer](https://wetransfer.com), offered the best means of sending larger files, such as complex Photoshop files and high-resolution JPG pictures. This strategic method made it easier to communicate and share files, which in turn made it possible to deliver  content for Beraria H.
