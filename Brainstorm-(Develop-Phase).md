## Brainstorming Techniques

### Technique 1: Rapid Ideation

<span dir="">To initiate the ideation phase, I proactively sought out effective brainstorming techniques to facilitate idea generation. One such technique, known as "Rapid Ideation," caught my attention. In this approach, a predetermined time limit is set to encourage the generation of a multitude of ideas. In preparation, I had formulated a set of How-Might-We questions, which were meticulously organized using Miro, a collaborative online platform. Subsequently, I dedicated a focused two-minute interval to conceive a response for each question. The process was systematically structured to promote creativity and innovation, aligning with the research foundation established earlier.</span>
